  utter_ask_definition_en:
    - text: "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition affecting communication, behavior, and social interaction. It's a spectrum, meaning symptoms vary widely. No two people with autism are the same. Think of it like a unique wiring in the brain. Autism is not a disease or illness, but a neurodevelopmental difference. For more awareness, check our Educational Hub in the app!"
    - text: "ASD, or Autism, impacts how someone communicates and interacts. It's different for everyone—like colors on a rainbow. Want more details? Our Educational Hub has in-depth info."

  utter_ask_doctors_en:
    - text: "Consult developmental pediatricians or child psychologists. In Pakistan, try AKUH (Karachi), Shifa (Islamabad), or local autism centers like Rising Sun."

  utter_ask_doctors_ur:

  utter_ask_definition_ur:
    - text: "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) ek dimaghi farq he jo baat cheet, rawaiya aur milne-julne ko asar andaz krta he. Yeh spectrum he yani har bache ke alamaat alag hote hain – koi do same nahi! Jaise dimagh ki alag wiring. Bimari nahi he yee, balkay zindagi bhar ka neurodevelopmental farq he. Zyada detail ke liye app ka Educational Hub zaroor dekhy!"   
  
  utter_ask_prevalence_en:
    - text: "As of 2025, globally around 1% of kids have autism. Rates are increasing due to better awareness and diagnosis. In some places, it's higher due to better detection. It's more recognized now than before. For country-specific stats, including Pakistan, check reliable sources like WHO or local health departments."
    - text: "Globally, around 1% of kids have autism. Numbers are rising because of awareness, not actual increase. Cool fact, huh? If you want more data, our app's Educational Hub has visualizations."

  utter_ask_prevalence_ur:
    - text: "2025 tak duniya bhar mein har 100 bachon mein se 1 ko autism hota he (1%). Ye number barh raha he behtar pehchaan aur awareness ki wajah se, asal mein izafa nahi hoa. Pakistan mein bhi ab zyada diagnose ho raha he. Stats ke liye WHO ya app ka Hub check kary."
    - text: "Global taur par 1% bachon ko autism diagnose hota ha. Numbers barh rahe hain agaahi ki wajah se, na ke asal izafay ki wajah sy nahi. Mazeed maloomat ky liye app ke Educational Hub visit kary."

  utter_ask_gender_prevalence_en:
    - text: "Autism is diagnosed about 4 times more in boys than girls, possibly due to biological differences (like genetic factors), diagnostic biases, or girls masking symptoms better. Girls may present differently, leading to underdiagnosis. Research is ongoing to understand this better, and it's important to recognize symptoms in all genders for accurate diagnosis."
    - text: "Boys get diagnosed more—ratio 4:1. Maybe genes or how symptoms show differently. Interesting topic! If you'd like resources on gender differences, check our app."

  utter_ask_gender_prevalence_ur:
    - text: "Autism ladkon mein 4 guna zyada diagnose hota hai ladkiyon se, shayad biological farq (jaise jiniyati amal), tashkheesi biases, ya ladkiyan behtar alamaat chhupati hain. Ladkiyan alag tarike se zahir karti hain, jiski wajah sy wo underdiagnose reh jati ha. Tehqeeq jaari hai, sab genders mein alamaat pehchaana zaroori ha."
    - text: "Larkon mein 4 guna zyada diagnose hota hai larkiyon se. Baat yeh hai ke larkiyon mein symptoms thore chhupay hue aur different tareeke se dikhte hain – woh aksar “mask” kar leti hain (apne aap ko normal dikhane ki koshish). Isliye bohat si larkiyan bari ho kar hi pata chalti hain. Ab research chal rahi hai ke larkiyon ko bhi jaldi pehchaana ja sake."

  utter_ask_vaccines_en:
    - text: "No link between vaccines and autism – debunked by science. Vaccines are safe and essential."

  utter_ask_vaccines_ur:
    - text: "Vaccines se autism nahi hota – science ne galat sabit kiya. Teekay zaruri aur safe hain."
  
  utter_ask_causes_en:
    - text: "We still don’t know the exact cause, but research points to a combination of genetics + some pregnancy/birth factors (like parents’ age or certain infections). The good news? It’s definitely NOT caused by parenting style, vaccines, fridge, mobile phones, or “nazar”. Science has ruled all of that out completely. No one is to blame."    
    - text: "Mix of genes and environment. No blame on parents—science says so. Dive into details? For example, genetic mutations or maternal infections during pregnancy are researched areas."

  utter_ask_causes_ur:
    - text: "Autism ki wajohaat mukammal tor par maaloom nahi, lekin jiniyati aur maholiati amal shaamil hain jaise umar daraz walidain, paidaish se pehle exposures. Walidain ki parwarish ya vaccines se nahi hota ye ik myth haa! Jiniyat ke bare mein bataun? Early madad farq dalti hai."
    - text: "100% ek wajah nahi hai. Genes ka bara role hai, aur pregnancy mein kuch cheezen (maa ki umar, infections, ya complications) bhi asar daal sakti hain. Lekin yeh baat pakki hai: vaccines se nahi hota, maa baap ki parenting se nahi hota, aur fridge ya mobile se bhi nahi. Yeh kisi ka qasoor nahi ❤️"
 
  utter_ask_genetics_en:
    - text: "Yes, genetics play a major role in autism, with over 100 genes linked. It's often inherited, but not always—mutations can occur spontaneously. Family history increases risk, especially for siblings (up to 20% chance if one has autism). Genetic testing can help identify risks, but it's not definitive for diagnosis."
    - text: "Autism has strong genetic components, but environment interacts too. If a parent has autism, the child has higher odds, but it's not 100%."

  utter_ask_genetics_ur:
    - text: "Haan, genes ka bara haath hai – 100 se zyada genes autism se linked hain. Agar ghar mein kisi ko hai to doosre bhai-behen ko chance 10–20% tak ho sakta hai (normal logon se zyada). Lekin yeh zaruri nahi ke har bache ko ho – bohat se cases mein naye mutations khud paida ho jate hain."
    - text: "Autism mein mazboot jiniyati amal hoty ha, mahol bhi asar karta ha. Agar walidain ko ho tw bachay ko hony ka zyada chance hota ha, lekin 100% nahi."

  utter_ask_diagnosis_en:
    - text: "Autism is diagnosed through behavioral observations, developmental history, and standardized tools like ADOS or M-CHAT for early screening. Usually by developmental pediatricians or psychologists. Early diagnosis (as young as 18 months) is key for intervention. No blood test, but comprehensive evaluation is needed."
    - text: "Diagnosis involves assessing communication, social skills, and behaviors. Professionals use criteria from DSM-5. If you suspect, consult a specialist—our app has screening tools to start."

  utter_ask_diagnosis_ur:
    - text: "Doctor bache ko khelte, baat karte, aur behave karte dekhte hain. Standardized tools hote hain jaise ADOS ya M-CHAT. Sab se best hai developmental pediatrician ya child psychologist. 18–24 mahine mein bhi reliable diagnosis ho sakti hai. Jitni jaldi, utni behtar madad milti hai."
    - text: "Diagnosis mei baat cheet, samaji hunar, rawaiye dekna shamil ha. DSM-5 criteria. Shak ho to specialist ko dekhaye ya hamari app mein screening tools ka istemal kary."

  utter_ask_symptoms_en:
    - text: "Symptoms include challenges with social interaction (e.g., eye contact, understanding emotions), communication (delayed speech, echolalia), repetitive behaviors (stimming, routines), and sensory sensitivities. Early signs: no babbling by 12 months, no pointing by 18 months. Varies widely—check our eductional hub for more details."
    - text: "Common signs: repetitive actions, difficulty with changes, intense interests. In adults: social fatigue, masking. Remember, it's a spectrum—professional assessment needed."

  utter_ask_symptoms_ur:
    - text: "Choti umar mein common nishaniyan:\n• 12 mahine tak smile ya babbling na karna\n• 18 mahine tak ishara na karna ya naam sun kar na dekhna\n• Eye contact kam ya bilkul nahi\n• Akelay khelna pasand\n• Ek hi cheez ko baar baar karna (jaise wheels ghumana)\n• Awaazon ya textures se pareshan hona\nLekin har bacha different hota hai – yeh sirf red flags hain, final nahi.- mazeed maloomat k liye educational hub visit kary."
    - text: "Aam alamaat: dohrana, tabdeelio mei mushkil, shiddat wale shoq. Baron mein: samaji thakan, chhupana. Spectrum hai—professional jaanch."

  utter_ask_stimming_en:
    - text: "Stimming (self-stimulatory behavior) is repetitive actions like hand-flapping, rocking, or spinning to regulate emotions or sensory input. Types: visual (staring at lights), auditory (humming), tactile (rubbing textures), vestibular (spinning). Common in autism for self-soothing— not always harmful, but monitor if injurious."

  utter_ask_stimming_ur:
    - text: "Stimming matlab apne aap ko calm karne ke chhote chhote movements – hath hilana, jhulna, ungliyan chakkar dena, ya kisi cheez ko baar baar chhuna. Yeh bache ka tareeqa hai tension ya excitement handle karne ka. Agar nuqsan nahi de raha to rokna nahi chahiye – yeh unka natural coping hai. Types: visual (lights dekhna), auditory (gunganana), tactile (textures ragarna), vestibular (ghumna), autism mein aam ha."

  utter_ask_why_stimming_en:
    - text: "Kids stim to self-regulate, manage sensory overload, express excitement, or reduce anxiety. It's a natural coping mechanism in autism due to different sensory processing. Benefits: calms the nervous system, improves focus. Not to 'fix' unless harmful—channel positively with fidget toys."
    - text: "Stimming provides comfort in overwhelming situations. Understanding why helps support— you're doing great by learning!"

  utter_ask_why_stimming_ur:
    - text: "Stimming se bacha apne nervous system ko balance karta hai. Sensory overload ho, excitement ho, ya anxiety – stimming se unko sukoon milta hai. Jaise hum chai peete hain tension mein, waise hi woh hath hilate hain. Yeh unka tareeqa-e-taskeen hai."

  utter_ask_therapy_en:
    - text: "Therapies include ABA (behavior skills), speech therapy (communication), occupational therapy (daily skills/sensory), play therapy (social). Best is individualized—start with assessment. In Pakistan, centers like Autism Resource Centre. Effectiveness high with consistency—our app connects to resources."

  utter_ask_therapy_ur:
    - text: "Therapies mein ABA (hunar), speech therapy (baat cheet), occupational therapy (rozana hunar/sensory), play therapy (samaji). Behtareen individual—assessment se shuru karna ha."
    - text: "Sab se common aur effective:\n1. Speech Therapy – bolna aur samajhna\n2. Occupational Therapy – sensory issues aur daily skills\n3. ABA – behaviors aur learning\n4. Play/Social Skills Therapy – dost banana\nPakistan mein Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad mein achhe centers hain. App mein bhi resources list hai."

  utter_ask_aba_therapy_en:

Benefits: reduces challenging behaviors, builds independence. Who benefits: kids with various needs. Enrollment: find certified therapists via our app."
    - text: "Why ABA? Evidence-based, customizable. After enrollment: consistent practice at home amplifies results—you're committed!"

  utter_ask_aba_therapy_ur:
    - text: "ABA ek scientific tareeqa hai jo chhoti chhoti steps mein naye hunar sikhata hai – tareeef aur inaam se. Sab se zyada research wali therapy hai autism ke liye. Agar pyar aur izzat ke saath ki jaye to zindagi badal deti hai – baat cheet, roz ka kaam, mushkil rawaiye sab mein farq parta hai."
    - text: "Why ABA? Evidence-based, customizable. After enrollment: consistent practice at home amplifies results—you're committed!"

  utter_ask_visual_aids_en:

    - text: "Benefits: improves understanding, independence. Start simple—great tool!"

  utter_ask_visual_aids_ur:
    - text: "Tasveeri cards, roz ka schedule, timer, samaji kahaniyan – yeh sab duniya ko predictable banate hain. Bache ko pata chalta hai “ab kya hoga”, to pareshani ghat jati hai. Non-verbal bachon ke liye PECS aur transition ke liye visual timer bohat kaam ke hain."

  utter_ask_daily_tips_en:
    - text: "Daily tips: establish routines, use visual supports, encourage communication (even non-verbal), sensory breaks. Play games for social skills, praise efforts. Track progress in our app—small wins add up! You're building a supportive environment."

  utter_ask_myths_ur:
    - text: "Afsaney: vaccines se autism hota ha (galat), buri parwarish sy autism hota ha (nahi), baray ho kar khatam hojata ha (nahi, sambhal sakta ha, control hosakta ha). Chhootne wala nahi ha, screens se nahi hota ye. Haqeeqat: neurodiversity, quwwatain. Doosron ko sikhayein"

  utter_ask_cure_en:

  utter_ask_cure_ur:

  utter_ask_eye_tracking_en:

  utter_ask_eye_tracking_ur:
    - text: "Nayi technology se dekhte hain bacha screen par kahan kahan dekhta hai. Autistic bachay chehron se zyada cheezon ko dekhte hain. Is se 6-12 mahine mein hi autism pakra ja sakta hai – jaldi therapy ke liye bohat zabardast! ha."

  utter_ask_triggers_ur:

  utter_ask_anxiety_sleep_ur:

  utter_ask_bilingual_therapy_en:

  utter_ask_high_low_functioning_en:
    - text: "We’re slowly moving away from “high/low functioning” labels because they’re misleading. Better to say “higher support needs” or “lower support needs” – focuses on what the person actually needs instead of boxing them."

  utter_ask_high_low_functioning_ur:
    - text: "High/low functioning labels ab kam use hote hain kyunke yeh confuse karte hain. Behtar hai kehna “zyada madad chahiye” ya “kam madad chahiye” – yeh asal zaroorat batata hai."

  utter_ask_loud_sounds_en:
