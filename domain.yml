        If one child has autism, the chance that a sibling will also have autism is higher than the general population, but still not extremely high:
        • General population risk: ~1 in 100 (1%)
        • Risk for younger/older siblings: 10–20% (10×–20× higher)
        • If the autistic child is a girl, the risk for siblings can be even higher (up to 30%).
        • Identical twins: 60–90% chance if one twin has it.

        These are averages – many families have only one autistic child. Early screening of younger siblings is free/recommended in most countries. Genetic counseling before planning another baby can also give you personalized numbers. You are not alone in this worry – thousands of Pakistani families ask this exact question every year. ❤️

        Agar ek bacha autistic hai to bhai/behen mein bhi autism hone ka risk thoda zyada hota hai, lekin bohat zyada nahi:
        • Aam logon mein chance: 100 mein se 1 (~1%)
        • Bhai/behen mein chance: 10–20% (10–20 guna zyada)
        • Agar autistic bacha ladki hai to risk aur bhi zyada ho sakta hai (30% tak)
        • Juraan (identical) twins mein: 60–90% chance

        Ye average numbers hain – bohat se gharanon mein sirf ek hi bacha autistic hota hai. Chhote bache ki jaldi screening karwa len (Pakistan mein aksar free hoti hai). Agla baby plan karne se pehle genetic counseling se apna personal risk bhi jaan sakte hain. Ye pareshani bohat si Pakistani families ko hoti hai – aap akeli nahi hain. ❤️

        • Give them 1-on-1 special time every day (even 10–15 minutes).
        • Explain autism in simple, age-appropriate words (“Your brother’s brain works differently – he needs extra help with some things”).
        • Let them ask any question – never say “don’t talk about it”.
        • Praise them when they help and also when they play independently.
        • Join sibling support groups (many cities in Pakistan have free ones).
        • Celebrate their own achievements loudly – they need to feel seen too.

It improves independence, social interaction, and reduces behaviors from overload.

They blamed autism on mothers being 'cold' or 'distant', saying a lack of warmth caused it. This caused so much pain and guilt for families — but science proved it false by the 1970s through twin studies showing it's genetic and neurodevelopmental. No parenting style causes autism; your love is perfect just as it is. Today, we know it's about brain differences, not blame."
